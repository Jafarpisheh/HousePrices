# HousePrices
Predicting the price of a house based on the information which is provided. The dataset consits 79 explanatory variables which can be used to train the model. RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor and LGBMRegressor are used and the results are compared. Additionally, RandomizedSearchCV is used to find the most optimum Hyperparameters for the RandomForest algorithm. The final results showed that LGBMRegressor has the best predicting power and this model is used to predict the prices of the test dataset
